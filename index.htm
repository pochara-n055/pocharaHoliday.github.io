	<h1>Neville and his Halloween Happenings</h1>

	<p>Halloween originated from a holiday on November 1st, called All Saints Day. The day before became known as All Hallows Eve, or shortened to Halloween. People would dress up in costumes and light bonfires to scare ghosts and spirits away, and it spread to the United States at some point. It became increasingly secular (less religious) around the early 1900's and now it is what it is today, dressing up in costumes and trick or treating witd candy.
	</p>
	
<p>Halloween is special for me because my sister had gone to a preschool for a few years. The school throws parties every Halloween, where there would be food, games, candy and many other cool things. One year we got a stuffed robin who we still have today. I also only went trick or treating twice in my whole life; I went once and I was too young to remember it, but for the second time I went, I was appalled by how much candy we got because I didn't know this stuff.</p>
